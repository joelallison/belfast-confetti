                                                            <p><h2>CONTEXT</h2><br>At the time that this poem is set, Ireland was deep in conflict; between the Nationalists and the Unionists.<br>
                                                            The Unionists wanted to be closer with England, and the United Kingdom, and the Nationalists didn't want anything to do with England or the Untited Kingdom. <br>
                                                            This conflict was deeply founded in religion. Unionists were typically protestant, and Nationalists were typically catholic. <br>
                                                            Unionists typically resided in Northern Ireland, and Nationalists typically resided in the Republic of Ireland (the southern bit).
