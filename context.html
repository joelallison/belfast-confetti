                                                            The Unionists wanted to be closer with England, and the United Kingdom, and the Nationalists didn't want anything to do with England or the Untited Kingdom. <br>
                                                            This conflict was deeply founded in religion. Unionists were typically protestant, and Nationalists were typically catholic. <br>
                                                            Unionists typically resided in Northern Ireland, and Nationalists typically resided in the Republic of Ireland (the southern bit).

                                                            Ciaran Carson, born in 1948, is a poet and novelist from Northern Ireland. Born into an Irish-speaking family, he went on to become Professor of English at Queen's University Belfast. <br> 
                                                            He combines a life-long passion for traditional music with a deep interest in politics.
