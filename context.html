                                                            <p><h2>CONTEXT</h2><br>At the time that this poem is set, Ireland was deep in conflict; between the Nationalists and the Unionists.<br>
                                                            The Unionists wanted to be closer with England, and the United Kingdom, and the Nationalists didn't want anything to do with England or the Untited Kingdom. <br>
                                                            This conflict was deeply founded in religion. Unionists were typically protestant, and Nationalists were typically catholic. <br>
                                                            Unionists typically resided in Northern Ireland, and Nationalists typically resided in the Republic of Ireland (the southern bit).

                                                            Ciaran Carson, born in 1948, is a poet and novelist from Northern Ireland. Born into an Irish-speaking family, he went on to become Professor of English at Queen's University Belfast. <br> 
                                                            He combines a life-long passion for traditional music with a deep interest in politics.

                                                            <p>He lived through what became to be known as 'The Troubles'. This was the era of Irish nationalist terrorism that marked UK social and political life from the 1970s to the 1990s. During that time organisations such as the IRA fought to end British rule of Northern Ireland.</p>
                                                            <p>The conflict in Northern Ireland began in the 1960s when the minority Catholic population began campaigning against discrimination by the Protestant majority. By the 1970s, some Irish nationalist groups had started using violence to force the UK government to make the region independent of Britain.</p>
                                                            <p>British troops became an everyday presence on the streets of Belfast, the Northern Irish capital. At first they had come to protect the Catholics from Protestant violence. Before long they became, to nationalists, symbols of an unwanted army of occupation. Violent clashes between protesters and the 'security forces' (the police and army) were common.</p>
