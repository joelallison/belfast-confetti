                                <p>Belfast Confetti

Suddenly as the riot squad moved in, it was raining <br> exclamation marks, <br>
Nuts, bolts, nails, car-keys. A fount of broken type. And the <br> explosion <br>
Itself—an asterisk on the map. This hyphenated line, a burst <br> of rapid fire… <br>
I was trying to complete a sentence in my head, but it kept <br> stuttering.
All the alleyways and side-streets blocked with stops and <br> colons. <br> <br>

                                I know this labyrinth so well—<mark>Balaclava, Raglan, Inkerman, <br> Odessa Street— <br> </mark>
                                Why can’t I escape? Every move is punctuated. <mark>Crimea <br> Street.</mark> Dead end again. <br>
A Saracen, Kremlin-2 mesh. Makrolon face-shields. Walkie- <br> talkies. What is
My name? Where am I coming from? Where am I going? A <br> fusillade of question marks.

                                 <p><h2>Meaning of the poem</h2> <br> A demonstration got out of hand and riot police have moved in to control it. The rioters throw things and there are explosions. 
Time is confused in the poet’s head. He try’s running to safety to make sense of everything happening but can’t escape. 
The place he knows so well becomes a trap, he gets held by the police and they question him. </p>
